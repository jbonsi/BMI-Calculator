# Body Mass Index (BMI)

A simple command-line Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that takes a user’s input in pounds, feet, and inches. It calculates the user’s BMI using the standard formula and classifies the result into categories like underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The BMI is rounded to the nearest tenth for precision. This project demonstrates efficient coding in Python3 with user-friendly input handling.
